00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,850 
someone to form an impression about
somebody

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,170 
well at times you meet new people and do
you think to yourself that

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,320 
oh my god this person was a little weird
or she was not at all impressive

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,340 
and are you afraid that you meeting
someone that person would also take the

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,469 
same about you

9
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,070 
well let these worries that bother you

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,739 
here are some tips that will help you to
create a good positive first impression

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,040 
the first that i have for you is to set
an intention

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,540 
now it is essential for you to set an
intention

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,110 
especially when you are going to attend
a big wet which means where you know

14
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,390 
that you're going to end up meeting some
new people that can be maybe at a

15
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:28,540 
conference or maybe it's some social
gathering or even a friend's party or

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,520 
even for an interview

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,140 
these are the places where you
definitely end up meeting new people

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,229 
so when you're getting ready you getting
dressed up or when you're driving or

19
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,979 
traveling to get to the event

20
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:51,369 
make sure that you stay calm and
composed and think what kind of

21
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:57,940 
interactions you would like to have with
these new people that you would meet now

22
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:04,030 
this is important because this will help
you to stay focused and also give you

23
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:09,130 
that positive energy for that kind of an
event that you would be attending

24
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:17,049 
so do set an intention little bit of
heart and some practice would help you

25
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,049 
to form a positive and pray

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,739 
that i have for you is to present
yourself appropriate me now definitely

27
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:35,900 
your physical appearance does matter
because the person that you are meeting

28
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,209 
for the first time doesn't have a clue
about you doesn't know anything about

29
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,120 
your experience about your intelligence
are about your knowledge all he can see

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,220 
is your physical appearance and that
would kind of give him an idea about

31
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,220 
what kind of person you are

32
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,090 
so it is important for you to dress
properly

33
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,480 
well if you are attending a business
meeting or if you are attending some

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,609 
kind of a formal event

35
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,909 
make sure you are dressed up in a formal
attire

36
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,250 
if you are attending a party or if you
were attending a social gathering

37
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,060 
make sure you are dressed appropriately

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,379 
now this doesn't mean that you have to
look like a model

39
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,489 
just perfect grooming and personal
hygiene would also help you

40
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,519 
so physical appearance would matter

41
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,879 
that's why it's important that you
present yourself appropriately

42
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:51,590 
that i have for you is to be open and
confident now body language does matter

43
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,200 
in fact it speaks louder than words so
it is important for you to show

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200 
confidence and how would you do that

45
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,330 
well you need to smile when you meet
someone for the first time make sure

46
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:12,409 
that you stand tall and project that
kind of confidence and of course make

47
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,420 
good eye contact

48
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,519 
that's extremely important because if
you are looking somewhere else when you

49
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,199 
are meeting someone

50
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,680 
it just doesn't show that you are
interested in meeting that new person so

51
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,740 
a good eye contact a firm handshake and
smiling would definitely help

52
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,800 
this would help you to project
confidence and please do a wide you're

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,900

meeting someone for the first time but

54
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:52,160 
do avoided like touching your phase are
biting nails or you know playing around

55
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,720 
with your hair or with your phone please

56
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,729 
so please be confident and this would
help you to create a good impression

57
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:16,080 
to be courteous and attended goes
without saying that good manners and

58
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,250 
being polite to someone definitely helps
and helps you to create a very positive

59
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,770 
impression on someone

60
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,590 
now your new acquaintances definitely
deserve a hundred percent of your

61
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,850 
attention

62
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,510 
of course when you are meeting someone
be polite

63
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:42,900 
be gentle okay you don't have to sound
very rude and make sure that you let

64
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,540 
them know that you are listening to them
and of course you don't start talking

65
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,080 
about stories about your collection of
shoes or you start talking that oh my

66
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,590 
god how adorable my puppy is ok

67
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,560 
these talks would not make any sense so
maybe you can talk about current affairs

68
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,940 
you can talk about music you can talk
about new movies

69
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,870 
okay make sure whatever you talk has
some sense ok

70
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,710 
and of course make sure that you listen
to the other person

71
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,850

while say goodbye to this person

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,840 
you can say oh it was great talking to
you Jane

77
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,070 
or you can say it was a pleasure meeting
you Jane

78
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:57,700 
and with this note you can exchange your
business cards or email addresses or
