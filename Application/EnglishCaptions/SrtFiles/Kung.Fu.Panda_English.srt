1
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,262
Oh-ooh!

2
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,568
Stairs.

3
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,406
I don't think I can...

4
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,608
You guys,
just start without me.

5
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,378
I'll catch up!

6
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,156
Sweet.

7
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,725
Ah.

8
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,477
Inner peace.

9
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,080
Inner peace.

10
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,451
Itchy nose.

11
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,726
Finally, inner peace.

12
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:36,728
Now what?

13
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,110
Kai, old friend.

14
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,481
Master oogway.

15
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:59,351
Our battle ended
500 years ago!

16
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,587
Well, now I'm ready
for a rematch.

17
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,422
Took you long enough!

18
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,240
You've grown stronger.

19
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,817
500 years in the spirit realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

20
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,320
I have taken the chi
of every master here.

21
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:36,855
No!

22
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,490
Yes.

23
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,260
And soon I will have
your power, too.

24
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,495
When will you realize?

25
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,330
The more you take,
the less you have.

26
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,187
With your chi,

27
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,790
I will finally be able
to return
to the mortal world.

28
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,494
And this time,
you won't be there
to stop me.

29
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,665
It was never my destiny
to stop you.

30
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,401
I have set another
on that path.

31
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,242
Then I will find him...

32
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,444
And take his chi, too.

33
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,899
Justice is about
to be served!

34
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,243
Whoo-hoo!

35
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,488
Yee-haw!

36
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,756
We'll have two
justice platters,
please.

37
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,790
Um... three.
Three.

38
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,325
And a few tofu buns.

39
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,459
Oh, the spicy noodle soup
for tigress.

40
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,594
Did you want
extra sauce with that?

41
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,662
She wants it
on the side.

42
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,330
On the side.
On the side.

43
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,333
- Go, dragon warrior!
- You can do it!

44
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,367
Go, dragon warrior!

45
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,669
Defend the valley!

46
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,037
Dragon warrior!

47
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,408
Go, dragon warrior!

48
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,942
Defend the valley!

49
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,947
Yee-haw!

50
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,550
You guys aren't doing
the dramatic pose,
are you?

51
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,686
Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

52
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,587
You guys,
never underestimate

53
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,456
the power
of a dramatic entrance.

54
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,691
I've heard about
some masters
who can win a fight

55
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,025
just by throwing
open a door.

56
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,028
Oh!

57
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,530
Dramatic entrance?

58
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,731
Master shifu.

59
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,733
The dragon warrior
is correct.

60
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,535
Really?
I was just making...

61
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,970
Uh, yeah.
I mean, yeah.
I am.

62
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,740
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

63
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,942
Hence,
the dramatic entrance.

64
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,554
Oh!

65
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,791
Nice dramatic entrance.
What's the occasion?

66
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,594
Today will be
my final class.

67
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,563
Your final...?
Wait.

68
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,964
I didn't even know
you were sick!

69
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:06,832
Although you have
been looking a little...

70
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm not sick.

71
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,569
...healthy.
A little healthy.
A lot, actually.

72
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:13,939
My final class,
because from now on...

73
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,441
Your training will be
in the hands

74
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,576
of the dragon warrior.

75
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,579
What?

76
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,884
Me, teach? Why not tigress?

77
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,785
She's always telling everyone
what to do.

78
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,053
Be quiet, po.

79
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,588
You see what I mean?

80
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,655
Tigress is not
the dragon warrior.

81
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,624
You are.

82
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,559
Come on,
they're the five.

83
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,495
What could I teach them?

84
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:39,765
There is always something
more to learn,
even for a master.

85
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:40,999
For instance...

86
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,901
Let me show you
another move...

87
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,404
The dramatic exit.

88
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,639
What's that?

89
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,042
Wow! Are you kidding me?

90
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,112
Where'd he go?

91
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,749
Master.

92
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,851
He's gone, guys.
It's cool.

93
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,454
We await your
instruction, master.

94
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,556
All you have to lose
is our respect.

95
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,096
I mean, seriously,
how bad can it be?

96
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,131
Very bad!
Very, very bad!

97
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,534
Okay, okay.
Let's switch it up.

98
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,868
Monkey!
Immovable mountain stance!

99
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,203
Yes, master!

100
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,740
Tigress, tornado back flip!

101
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:22,808
Yes, master.

102
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,977
Oh, no! Fire!

103
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,212
- Fire!
- Stop!

104
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,547
Sorry! My fault.

105
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,149
Crane, go high.
I mean low! Low!

106
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,952
Ah, my claw thingy!

107
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,954
Uh, viper and tigress, do,

108
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,990
uh, like,
a totem pole
poison technique!

109
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,227
Uh, you two,
do a swarming insect bite...

110
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,597
With a yellow tail,
yellow jacket, spicy tuna...

111
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,631
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,172
Good job, po.

113
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,609
Ah!

114
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,511
Did you at least learn
a little something?

115
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,812
Yes.

116
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,881
That you can't teach.

117
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,649
And tigress is flammable,
it turns out.

118
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,926
Yeah, that was
a complete disaster.

119
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,728
Uh, I'm glad
we're not po right now.

120
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,963
What a loser!

121
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,631
What was shifu thinking?

122
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,765
What was oogway thinking?

123
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,671
I think he heard us.

124
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,840
I didn't hear anything.

125
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,141
Uh, he said
you're a loser.

126
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,556
I'm sorry, oogway.

127
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,693
Would you stop doing that?

128
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,961
How was your
first day teaching?

129
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,563
Humiliating.

130
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,898
I heard.

131
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,699
Who told you?
Did tigress tell you?

132
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,868
I heard from monkey,
and crane, and mantis...

133
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,971
And your dad, and Mrs. chao
from the gift shop...

134
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,106
And those ducks
you just passed...

135
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,308
And tigress told me.

136
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,976
Did she also tell you that
it'll never happen again?

137
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,144
Because I'm done.

138
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,713
Teaching or
being humiliated?

139
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,081
Both! I don't know
why you ever thought

140
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:10,849
I could teach that class.

141
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,285
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

142
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,588
What?
You set me up
to fail? Why?

143
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,690
If you only do
what you can do,

144
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,793
you will never be
more than you are now.

145
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,129
I don't wanna be more!
I like who I am.

146
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,065
You don't even know
who you are.

147
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,633
What do you...?
Of course I do.

148
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,735
I'm the dragon warrior.

149
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,771
And what exactly does
that mean, dragon warrior?

150
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,875
Hmm.

151
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,911
It means, you know,
just going around

152
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,680
and punching and kicking.

153
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,082
Defending the valley!
And stuff.

154
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,784
Punching and kicking?

155
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,085
You think that is what

156
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,753
the great master oogway
saw for you?

157
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,191
A 500-year prophecy
fulfilled

158
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,127
so you could
spend your days
kicking butt...

159
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,330
And running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

160
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,632
Yes?
No!

161
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,603
Oogway saw greatness
in you, po.

162
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,838
Against my better judgment.

163
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,808
More than you can see
in yourself.

164
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,910
Incredible power
awaits you.

165
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,282
Power beyond anything
you can imagine.

166
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,866
Wow! What was that?

167
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,701
That was chi.

168
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,736
Wow!

169
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,005
What's chi?

170
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:44,743
The energy that flows
through all living things.

171
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,978
So you're saying
if I teach,

172
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,079
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

173
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,315
No. I'm saying
if you teach,

174
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,017
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that.

175
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,718
Oh.

176
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,988
Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

177
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,090
Oogway sat alone
in a cave

178
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,327
for 30 years
asking one question.

179
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,295
"Who am I?"

180
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,931
"Who am I?"

181
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,833
I'm lucky
if I get five minutes

182
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,268
before you interrupt...

183
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,370
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

184
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,738
Eventually.

185
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,874
After you master teaching.

186
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,977
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

187
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,979
I'm not trying
to turn you into me.

188
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:24,783
I'm trying to turn you
into you.

189
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,055
Turn me into me?

190
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,389
Wait a second,
that makes no...

191
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,091
Almost there, shifu.

192
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,460
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next oogway.

193
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,063
Hmm...Oh! Uh...

194
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,465
Sorry, no offense,
master oogway. I just...

195
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:42,801
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

196
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,878
What is this place?

197
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,346
Uh... my brother's farm?

198
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,849
Ah.

199
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,318
If I stepped on you,
would you die?

200
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,520
Yes.

201
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,257
The mortal realm.

202
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,394
You hear that, oogway?
I'm back.

203
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,865
Kai has returned!

204
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,067
Who?

205
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,070
Kai. General Kai.

206
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,506
Supreme warlord
of all China.

207
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,075
Huh?

208
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:01,012
The Jade slayer.
Master of pain.

209
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,148
You may know me as
the beast of vengeance.

210
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,783
Uh... maker of widows?

211
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:06,551
Uh...

212
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,988
Okay, I used to
work with oogway.

213
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,322
Oh, master oogway!

214
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,824
Now, he was a great warrior.

215
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,092
We've heard
of master oogway.

216
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,994
Okay, okay, enough.
Silence!

217
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,571
Find oogway's students,
and bring them to me.

218
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,415
By the time I am done
with them, oogway...

219
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:41,553
There will be no one left
who will even
remember your name.

220
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:45,123
Kai is coming!

221
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,594
I am ready...

222
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,530
To teach you a lesson.

223
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,999
Teach me? Oh, no!
It's the dragon teacher!

224
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,467
Yeah, he's so handsome!

225
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,502
Thank you
for the compliment.

226
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,907
No! Please don't
teach me to death!

227
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,109
Po?

228
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,611
Oh, hey, dad.
What's up?

229
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,482
I was just, uh...
Stopping by for
a little soak.

230
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,588
Okay. What's wrong?

231
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,989
Nothing.

232
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,024
Nothing? I come home

233
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,259
to find you taking
a bath with your dolls...

234
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,861
Action figures.

235
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,029
...and instead of adding
bath salts to the water,

236
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,097
you just added
szechuan peppercorns.

237
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,365
Szechuan...

238
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,102
Oh, oh, my tenders! Oh...

239
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,973
Okay, yes,
something's wrong.

240
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,274
There, there, son.

241
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,076
You tell your daddy
all about it.

242
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,444
Lift your arm.

243
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,212
Shifu says I don't know
what it means

244
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,047
to be the dragon warrior.

245
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,250
Now I have to
be a teacher?

246
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,051
I thought I finally
knew who I was.

247
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,254
If I'm not
the dragon warrior,
who am I?

248
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,389
A teacher?
Teaching kung fu?

249
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,658
Po, that's a promotion!

250
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,193
Take the job, son!

251
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,394
And, someday when
you're in charge

252
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,062
of the whole Jade palace...

253
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,466
I can sell noodles
in the lobby!

254
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,201
Why are you still here
taking a bath like a baby?

255
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,602
Get out! Get up!

256
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:08,239
Go, go, go!
Franchise expansion
awaits us!

257
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,108
But what about
the dragon warrior
look-alike contest?

258
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,175
Oh, Mrs. chow
always wins that.

259
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,012
Skadoosh.

260
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,080
And the dragon warrior
dumpling-eating contest?

261
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,548
I have to defend my title.

262
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,385
No one's gonna beat your
dumpling-eating record.

263
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:21,519
Someone's about to beat your
dumpling-eating record!

264
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,189
Go! Go!

265
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,557
Who's eating
my dumplings?

266
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,558
And who's
paying for them?

267
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,561
101! 102!

268
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,370
103!

269
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,146
Yeah!

270
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,147
Is that a new record?

271
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,349
Who are you?

272
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,384
I am li shan.

273
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,285
What?

274
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,424
I'm li shan.

275
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,492
I'm looking for my son.

276
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,998
You lost your son?

277
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,333
Yes.

278
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,201
Many years ago.

279
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,303
I lost my father.

280
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,372
I'm very sorry.

281
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,975
Thank you.

282
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,179
Well, good luck to you.

283
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,581
You, too.

284
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,149
I hope you find your son.

285
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,052
And I hope you find
your father.

286
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,431
Son?

287
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,333
Oh, my gosh,
it is you!

288
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,703
Well, don't just stand there.
Give your old man a hug!

289
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,309
I can't believe
you're alive!

290
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,384
Oh, I thought I lost
you forever, little lotus.

291
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,718
Uh...

292
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,587
Okay. Uh, this is
very embarrassing...

293
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,621
But I think you've
got me confused

294
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,389
with a panda
named lotus.

295
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,257
My name is po.

296
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,559
Oh, right,
you wouldn't know.

297
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,595
Oh. Okay.
See, little lotus

298
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,597
was the name
you were given at birth.

299
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,232
Really?
Really!

300
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,500
I can't believe it!

301
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,268
After all these years,
you're really here?

302
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,403
This is amazing!

303
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,138
Oh, dad!

304
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,540
Come! Say hi to, um...

305
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,742
I don't know what
I'm supposed to call you.

306
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,411
I'm pretty sure
he said his name is li.

307
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,413
You.

308
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,181
Come here.

309
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,382
Oh...

310
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,317
Thank you, thank you

311
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,586
for taking such good care
of my son.

312
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:39,157
Your son?
Now, hold on just a minute.

313
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,693
How do we know this stranger
is even related to you?

314
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,362
Look at that.

315
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,430
Our bellies
could be brothers!

316
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,798
That is so cool.

317
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,833
Hey, son, let me teach you
how to belly gong.

318
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,568
- All right. Belly gong.
- They jiggle the same!

319
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,703
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.

320
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,238
It's like looking
in a fat mirror.

321
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,143
I can't believe we're taking
a picture together.

322
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,446
Huh?

323
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,416
But I still
don't understand.

324
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,518
I thought po
was the only panda left.

325
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,188
No.
There's a whole
bunch of us.

326
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,156
Where?

327
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,225
A secret panda village
in the mountains.

328
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,393
A secret panda...

329
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,562
Whoa.

330
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,497
But how did you know
where I was?

331
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,400
I received a message
that led me here.

332
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,235
How could you receive
a message

333
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,571
if no one could find you?

334
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,505
Sounds suspicious to me.

335
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,407
Hmm?

336
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,642
No, it was a message
from the universe.

337
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,577
Whoa!
Whoa.

338
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,512
Rats!

339
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,648
Now, what's all
this about a dragon warrior?

340
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,517
How did you know
i was a dragon warrior?

341
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,518
Did the universe
tell you that, too?

342
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,387
No, the poster did.

343
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,222
And the gift shop.

344
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,457
I bought a tiny cup.

345
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,627
Oh, right, of course!

346
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,430
You have no idea.
There's so much
to show you.

347
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,564
You're gonna be
so awesomely proud.

348
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,199
Come on, come on!

349
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,537
I'm already
awesomely proud.

350
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,643
- Couple more steps.
- Give me a minute.

351
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,512
Feeling the burn.

352
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,714
Do you have
panda asthma, too?

353
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,582
Does that run
in the family?

354
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,485
Dad, you're gonna
love this.

355
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,586
It's, like,
the coolest thing ever.

356
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,657
This is
the hall of heroes.

357
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,892
Home of
the most priceless

358
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,693
kung fu artifacts
in all of China!

359
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,763
Whoa!
This place is...

360
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,598
Awesome?
Were you gonna say...

361
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,333
You were gonna say "awesome,"
right? Because it totally is!

362
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,435
Totally!
But be super careful.

363
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,503
Everything's very
fragile here.

364
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,372
Like the urn
of whispering warriors.

365
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,740
Someone broke that once.

366
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,441
Who?
Some idiot.

367
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,510
Wow!

368
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,479
This is
master flying rhino's
battle armor!

369
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,248
I wonder
if I could fit in that.

370
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,350
Get out of my head, dad!
I've wondered the same thing!

371
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,585
If I could fit in it?

372
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,786
If you could?
No, if I could fit.

373
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,388
Oh.
Dad, check it out!

374
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,624
Master ram's crossbow,
the infamous gate smasher.

375
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,193
Dad, look at this!

376
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,494
The battle helmets
of master rat's army.

377
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,562
They're so tiny!

378
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,364
Master dolphin's
waterproof armor!

379
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,632
This is my favorite.

380
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,367
Check it out.
It's the legendary

381
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,335
battle rickshaw
of emperor hawk.

382
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,538
Sweet ride.

383
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:09,941
Dad, what are you doing?

384
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,642
We're not supposed
to touch anything!

385
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,345
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Should I put it back?

386
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,314
Yeah, you probably should.

387
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,382
You look so cool, though.

388
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,984
How does it feel?

389
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,520
Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

390
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,388
Does it feel like
you're impenetrable?

391
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,424
Does it feel like
you could take on
a thousand warriors...

392
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,460
And emerge unscathed?

393
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,596
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

394
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,564
Ooh!

395
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,999
I wonder what this does.
I should pull it.

396
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,011
I think I just
peed a little.

397
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,583
Anything else
we should try in here, son?

398
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,018
Hmm?

399
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,859
Charge!

400
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,761
Faster, faster, faster!

401
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,563
Thumb war!

402
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,931
Reinforcements!
Ooh. Ooh.

403
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,566
No fair. No fair.

404
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:10,635
Yeah!

405
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,304
This is so much fu...

406
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,742
Here we go!
Go, go, go!

407
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,610
Awesome!
Faster, faster, faster.

408
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,978
There, there.

409
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,346
I'm fine, I'm fine.

410
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,582
There you go.

411
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,651
Dolphin-style attack!

412
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,719
You got me.
Dolphin-style retreat!

413
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,489
Go long, son!

414
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,991
Whoa!

415
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,993
I wasn't ready!

416
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,928
Coming back at you.
I got it.

417
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,597
I'm going high!
There you go.

418
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,531
Come on, throw it!

419
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,933
I'm coming for you.

420
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,503
Bring it on, master rhino.

421
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,305
Here I come!

422
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,741
Oh!

423
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,749
I'm gonna get you.
I am gonna get you!

424
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,785
I'm gonna get you,
I'm gonna get you!

425
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,620
Psst. Psst. Psst
I'm gonna get you.

426
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,922
Who's got you?
Who's gonna get you?

427
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,625
Who's gonna get you?
Yeah. Who's gonna get you?

428
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,696
Master rhino.

429
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,497
What? What's wrong?

430
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,705
Hello.

431
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,040
Guys, guys.

432
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,909
You're never gonna guess
who just showed up.

433
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,744
Not in a million years.

434
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:27,912
You just try.

435
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,747
Your father!

436
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,615
Whoa!
How did you just
guess that?

437
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,516
Oh, wait a second.
Oh, yeah, of course.

438
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,617
We look exactly the same.

439
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,753
Dad, say hi to my friends.

440
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,923
Mantis, tigress,
monkey, crane, and viper.

441
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:41,492
Oh, viper, was it?
Monkey, sir.

442
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,694
They're kind of
my best friends.
And this...

443
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,030
This is master shifu.
Legend.

444
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:49,633
Uh... it is an honor
to meet you, master panda.

445
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,001
Perhaps your father
would care to join us

446
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,603
in the training hall.

447
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,472
Your son will be
teaching the class.

448
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,541
Oh, ho, ho!
I'm sure he's tired.

449
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,377
I'm sure you're tired.
He's tired.

450
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,644
I'm gonna show him
to the chrysanthemum suite.

451
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,747
What, tired?
No, I'm fine.

452
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,415
I would love
to watch you teach.

453
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,683
Trust me, it'll be more fun
just to watch me...

454
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:06,817
Fight!

455
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,619
What is that?

456
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,653
The valley's under attack.

457
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,790
Son? Under attack?

458
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,024
This is perfect!

459
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,159
Now you can see what being

460
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,660
the dragon warrior's
all about!

461
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:17,561
Follow me!

462
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,773
Enemies of justice,
prepare for war!

463
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,040
Are you kidding me? Whoa!

464
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,644
Ow!

465
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,152
What's the deal
with the green guys?

466
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:43,754
Some kind of Jade zombies.

467
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,456
Jade zombies?

468
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,724
Jombies! Jinx!

469
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:47,992
Ow!

470
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,894
Lotus, be careful!

471
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,729
It's okay, dad,
i do this every day!

472
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,033
Whoa!
I recognize these guys.

473
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,835
The master badger twins,

474
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,437
with their crushing
double-gong technique!

475
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,671
Ow!

476
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,673
Yeah, that's the one!

477
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,707
And that guy is...

478
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,476
No! Master porcupine!

479
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,048
I thought he died
a hundred years ago.

480
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,650
These guys are legend!

481
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,085
Get a quick sketch of us.

482
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,627
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

483
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,130
Oh, I blinked.

484
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:26,864
Can we get another one?

485
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,470
I'm being choked
by master porcupine.

486
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:33,137
This is so cool.

487
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,940
Oh! Oh, look. It's you!

488
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:38,042
Po, focus!

489
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,044
"Message from the universe."

490
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:42,112
I'll give you a message
from the universe.

491
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,714
Stay away from my son!

492
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,217
Sorry, dad.
I'll clean up later.

493
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,818
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not my good pan!

494
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,719
Uh, take this one.

495
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:52,523
Lotus! Watch out!

496
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,794
Whoa!

497
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,597
Dad, check out
my dumplings of doom.

498
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:11,942
Gotcha.

499
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,582
I see you.

500
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,186
<i> Your chi will soon be mine.</i>

501
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,587
Is he talking to me?
Which one?

502
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,855
They're all talking.

503
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,258
Whoa, you're right.
That's so scary.

504
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,260
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary
back at them.

505
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:31,028
Okay, but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first.

506
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,730
Otherwise, it won't be scary.
It'll just be stupid.

507
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,132
<i> It's not them talking,</i>
<i> you idiots!</i>

508
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:36,166
<i> It's me talking</i>
<i> through them. Kai!</i>

509
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,068
Who?

510
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,770
Okay, okay, okay.
Enough.

511
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,045
Did you see that?
What just happened?

512
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,114
The green smoke,
just poof!
And then poof!

513
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,916
Shifu, what was that?

514
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:55,185
Kai... Kai... Kai...

515
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,654
Nope, never heard of him.

516
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,656
Kai... Kai...

517
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,925
Where is it?

518
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,660
There's so much
wisdom in here,
i can't find anything.

519
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:03,627
Yes!

520
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,630
Behold.

521
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,967
All the answers
will be found within.

522
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,338
What? It's blank?

523
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,075
Are you kidding me?
Not again.

524
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,879
Wait, wait, hold on.
Sorry.

525
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,881
Oh, okay. Here we go.

526
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,885
It is written
in oogway's hand.

527
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,020
"Long ago,
i had a brother..."

528
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,056
Oogway had a brother?

529
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,326
"In arms. In arms."
Sorry. He says,
"brother-in-arms."

530
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,794
Maybe you should just
unroll it all at once?

531
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,366
"I was an ambitious
young warrior
leading a great army."

532
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,037
<i> And fighting</i>
<i> by my side was Kai...</i>

533
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,274
<i> My closest friend.</i>

534
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,647
<i> One day,</i>
<i> we were ambushed.</i>

535
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,216
<i> I was badly wounded.</i>

536
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,753
<i> My friend carried me</i>
<i> for days,</i>
<i> looking for help...</i>

537
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,223
<i> Until we came</i>
<i> to a secret village...</i>

538
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,359
<i> High in the mountains.</i>

539
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:11,228
<i> An ancient</i>
<i> place of healing.</i>

540
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,231
<i> A village of pandas.</i>

541
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,066
Pandas?

542
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,702
<i> Yes, pandas.</i>

543
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:22,106
<i> Pandas who used</i>
<i> the power of chi</i>
<i> to heal me.</i>

544
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,412
<i> They taught me</i>
<i> how to give chi.</i>

545
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:37,821
<i> Oh, but Kai wanted</i>
<i> the power all to himself.</i>

546
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,060
<i> He saw that what could be</i>
<i> given could also be taken.</i>

547
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,299
<i> I had to stop him.</i>

548
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,007
<i> Our battle</i>
<i> shook the earth...</i>

549
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,109
<i> Until, finally...</i>

550
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,846
<i> I banished Kai</i>
<i> to the spirit realm.</i>

551
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,683
<i> Should he ever return</i>
<i> to the mortal realm...</i>

552
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:09,820
<i> He can only be stopped</i>
<i> by a true master of chi.</i>

553
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:11,188
"True master of chi"?

554
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,890
Like you!

555
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,792
Me? I can barely
make a flower bloom.

556
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:17,194
I need at least
30 more years,
and a cave.

557
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,429
We need a chi master.

558
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:20,698
He will
continue stealing

559
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,332
the chi of masters
until he has
consumed it all.

560
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,967
We have to think
of a way to stop him!

561
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,135
He'll get more
and more powerful

562
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,004
with every master
he defeats.

563
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,172
- There is no choice.
- We fight.

564
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:29,973
I can teach you, son.

565
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,811
You can do this?

566
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:37,247
Of course.
I'm a panda.

567
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,083
That must be why
the universe
sent you here!

568
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,319
Okay, so what do i
have to do?

569
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,121
You have to come home
with me.

570
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:45,355
What?

571
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,957
To the secret village?

572
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,392
Yes, son.

573
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:52,096
You must rediscover
what it is to be a panda.

574
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,064
You have to learn
to live like a panda,

575
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,165
sleep like a panda...

576
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,367
Eat like a panda.

577
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,971
Those 103 dumplings?

578
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,273
I was just warming up.

579
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,975
I've always felt like
i wasn't eating up

580
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:05,976
to my full potential.

581
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,379
No, you can't take po
away from me. No, no.

582
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,215
I want a second opinion.

583
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,016
Shifu, open another scroll
or something.

584
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,252
I think he should go.

585
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,087
Fine, a third opinion.

586
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,423
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

587
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,459
Dad, you heard
what shifu said
oogway said.

588
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:25,295
This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

589
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,965
And I can only master chi
by knowing who I really am.

590
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,834
Well, I'm a panda.

591
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,874
I'll pack you a lunch
for the road.

592
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,917
Do you really think
po can master chi in time?

593
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,485
Doesn't matter
what I think.

594
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,287
It only matters
what the universe thinks.

595
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,556
So, that's a "no"?

596
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,424
Master, what are
we going to do?

597
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,493
You are going to find out
where Kai is.

598
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,828
Follow the trail
of those Jade creatures.

599
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,230
But do not engage...

600
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:03,467
For with every foe he faces,
Kai becomes stronger.

601
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,969
Why me?
Is it because I asked?

602
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,905
No. It is because
you can fly. Go!

603
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,275
Should have kept
your beak shut.

604
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:12,576
And take mantis.

605
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:13,944
Oh, man.
Is it because I...?

606
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:14,945
Yes.

607
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:42,906
Oh! Lunch break.

608
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,174
Oh.

609
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,876
You don't need
to ask me twice.

610
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,444
Dad?

611
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,112
Yes?
Dad?

612
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,581
Yes?

613
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,115
What are you doing here?

614
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,852
What am I doing?
Getting a backache.

615
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,854
Did you have to step
on every rock?

616
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,589
No, I mean,
why are you here?

617
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,390
What was I supposed
to do, huh?

618
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,893
What if the pandas
don't have food you like?

619
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,461
You're never gonna be able
to save the world

620
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,496
on an empty stomach.

621
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,966
I consider my presence
mission critical.

622
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,934
Oh... yes, about that...

623
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:14,872
We can't share
the location of the village
with others. So...

624
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,541
Well, you think I can't
keep a secret, huh?

625
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,943
I raised po for 20 years

626
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,979
before I finally told him
he was adopted.

627
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,248
Seriously?
Yeah.

628
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,984
Okay. I guess it would be
cruel to make you fly back.

629
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,420
You can fly?

630
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,521
I'm a bird, po.

631
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,473
We're here.

632
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,980
Sure looks like a long
ways up there.

633
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,483
And my son hates stairs.

634
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,251
So, let's go home.

635
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,054
We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.

636
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,422
I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.

637
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,494
Rats.

638
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,672
Whoa... huh?

639
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,954
This is the secret
panda village?

640
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,222
No wonder
you keep it a secret.

641
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,425
If I lived here,
i wouldn't tell
anyone either.

642
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,998
Now you can "whoa."

643
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,368
Whoa!

644
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,704
- Let's go!
- Over here! Come on!

645
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,515
Look over there!

646
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:18,495
Oh...

647
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,632
My turn! My turn!
Come on, faster, faster!

648
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,069
Li?

649
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,138
Everyone! Li's back!

650
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,173
They're both back!
He found his son!

651
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,208
He made it!
They're back!

652
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,043
Li?
He found his son!

653
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,012
Everyone! Li's back!

654
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,080
Hang on, we're coming!

655
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,182
He made it!
Whoo-hoo!

656
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,118
They made it!
Why are we running?

657
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,652
- Here we come!
- He's back!

658
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,554
They made it!

659
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,124
Li shan is back!

660
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,634
Hi!

661
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,236
Everyone!

662
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,471
Everyone, gather around!
This is my son!

663
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:02,739
Hello, hi.
He's here!

664
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,174
You're here!
Triplets!

665
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,809
Hi, I'm ku ku!

666
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:05,809
I'm meng meng.
I'm shuai shuai.

667
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:09,079
Your fur is soft.
He smells like cookies.

668
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:12,249
He's so handsome,
just like his father.

669
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,683
Thank you.

670
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,819
Son, these are your cousins.

671
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,087
Dim and sum.

672
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,555
I have cousins!

673
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,756
Welcome!
Welcome!

674
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,525
Whoa! Buns on a string.

675
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:22,759
We call it a snacklace.

676
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,427
That's right.

677
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,762
Uh... we'll make you
another one.

678
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,164
Oh!

679
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,698
It's you!

680
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,268
So...That's nice.
Yeah, hi!

681
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,403
I don't know who you are.

682
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,672
Oh, stripy baby.
So beautiful.

683
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,076
Oh! Okay, careful with that.
That's my action figure.

684
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,844
Can I keep her? Can I?
No...

685
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,281
...problem. Of course.

686
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,315
Yeah.
That's why I brought her.

687
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,716
Take good care of her.

688
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,585
Yes! Stripy baby.

689
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,824
You look just like me,
but a baby.

690
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,796
You're like me, but old.

691
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,866
You're like me,
but fatter!

692
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,134
You're like me, but...

693
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,770
...with a hat.

694
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,107
He does wear a hat!

695
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,441
You all look like me.

696
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,712
Let's feast
in my son's honor.

697
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,316
What the...?

698
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,418
Pandas don't walk.
We roll!

699
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,892
Have you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?

700
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,696
Po, what are you doing? Po!

701
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,677
Ohh! Ow!

702
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,579
You're right,
that is better than walking.

703
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,516
Mmm!

704
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,751
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

705
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:54,751
Have some dumplings.

706
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:58,655
What kind of panda
doesn't know how to roll?

707
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,191
Well, I'm kind of new at this
whole "being a panda" thing.

708
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,592
Hey, what kind of panda
are you?

709
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,194
You have a funny neck.

710
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,428
I'm not a panda at all.

711
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,730
What's that? What's that?
My hat. My beak.

712
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:07,797
What's that?
My wing.

713
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,566
What's that?
My dumplings.

714
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,902
No more questions!
Go away, kid.

715
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,470
Here, son.
I packed your chopsticks.

716
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,738
- Thanks, dad.
- Wow.

717
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,540
Oh, my.
What?

718
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,708
What are those for?

719
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,910
These?
These are chopsticks.

720
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:20,944
They're for picking
up dumplings.

721
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:23,446
You mean you only eat
one at a time?

722
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,617
Yummy.
Yeah, yummy.

723
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:32,622
I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential!

724
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,865
Huh?

725
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,940
I am Mei Mei.

726
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:53,310
Wow, she's amazing.
She's so beautiful.

727
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,945
That's sweet, po.

728
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:57,380
But please, try to save
all other compliments

729
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,782
until after
the performance.

730
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,885
Me? No, I didn't say...

731
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:05,255
Shut it.

732
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,923
After the performance.

733
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,692
Huh! Has it started yet?

734
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:15,565
Best ribbon dancer
in the world!

735
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,967
At least,
that's what she said.

736
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,768
Look away. Look away.

737
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,438
No. You can't, can you?

738
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,707
Dad, why does she
keep staring at me like...

739
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:24,808
That!

740
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,276
Try to keep up.

741
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,846
I don't really know
how to dance!

742
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:32,549
Of course you do.
All pandas dance.

743
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:34,684
I know what
you were thinking.

744
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,353
You do?

745
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,421
"How can one
panda be so beautiful?"

746
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,893
For me? Oh!

747
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,328
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

748
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,030
Po.

749
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,932
Help me, dads.
Yeah, no,
you're on your own.

750
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:49,866
You're doing great, son.

751
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,503
Your turn.

752
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:58,975
Oh!

753
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,748
Huh?

754
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:07,984
Yay, po!

755
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,022
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it.

756
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,692
I have so much to learn.

757
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,503
Wings of surveillance!

758
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,571
Why do you do that?
Do what?

759
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,373
Just because you say
"wings of"
before something...

760
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,975
It doesn't mean that you're
doing a special move.

761
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,344
It's like me saying
"antenna of power"

762
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:37,480
or "thorax of
making sandwiches."

763
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,848
Wings of disagreement.

764
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,916
Whoa! There.

765
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,054
Master bear,
master chicken, master croc!

766
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,722
What are you doing out here?

767
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,457
Jade creatures
attacked our villages.

768
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,358
We've tracked them here.

769
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,793
Stop!

770
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,432
They must be in there.

771
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,800
Master shifu strongly
advised us...

772
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,839
Not to engage.

773
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,374
We've gotta get in there.
But master shifu said...

774
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:05,809
You're seriously afraid?

775
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:08,445
Even master chicken's going
in there! And he's a chicken.

776
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,988
That's it. I'm going in.

777
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,923
Mantis! We have orders
not to...

778
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,124
They need our help!

779
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,026
Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.

780
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:23,860
No, wait.

781
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,463
Fear the bug!

782
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:27,864
All right, you little...

783
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,366
Uh-oh!

784
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:30,600
Hold on, buddy.
I'm coming!

785
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,836
Antenna of power!
Ah! It didn't work!

786
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:33,837
Mantis!

787
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,876
Mantis?

788
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,012
Mantis.

789
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,960
Your chi is strong.

790
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,962
Just like your friend...

791
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,064
The bug.

792
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,032
Mantis.

793
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,410
Don't worry, little birdie.

794
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,413
I'll put your chi
to good use...

795
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:21,418
Destroying the Jade palace
and everyone in it.

796
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:22,786
No!

797
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,028
Wings of regret!

798
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,137
Hmm. Oh, yeah.

799
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,605
First day
of panda training!

800
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,441
All right, flower.

801
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,443
I'm gonna
make you bloom.

802
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,478
Whoo-hoo!

803
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,946
Dad. Dad.

804
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,514
What? What? What is it?

805
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,049
I'm ready for my first day
of panda training.

806
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,551
What?
You know, learn to be

807
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,486
a panda, master chi,
save the world!

808
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:59,022
Pandas sleep till past noon.

809
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,090
So lesson number one is,
"go back to bed."

810
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,726
Oh! Of course!

811
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,131
Nobody said this was
gonna be easy.

812
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,238
Did I oversleep?

813
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,940
You sure did.

814
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:18,174
Yes!

815
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,542
Yeah! Show him, kids!

816
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,511
Can you do this?
Can you do that?

817
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:22,745
How about this?
How about that?

818
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,581
Am I doing it? Is this good?
Whoa!

819
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,882
I got it! Ka-blam!

820
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,184
Whoa!

821
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,018
Grandma panda, heads up!
Hello! Ow!

822
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,087
Oh.
Uh-oh.

823
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,522
We better roll.

824
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,024
Po, lunch time.

825
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,192
Oh!

826
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,199
Po?

827
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,268
You gotta let the hill
tell you where to roll.

828
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,237
Oh! Rookie mistake.

829
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:50,206
Dim, sum, let's show him
how we go uphill!

830
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,041
Whoo-hoo!

831
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,743
It's beautiful.

832
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,179
Snack time. Po!
Whoo-hoo!

833
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,047
You can fly?

834
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,817
I'm coming in hot!

835
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,285
Get them while
they're cold. Hmm.

836
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,523
What are you doing there?

837
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:07,924
That food is for po!

838
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:08,791
Throw it in!

839
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:14,597
There, there.
That's it.

840
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,833
Feeling relaxed?
Totally.

841
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,601
Just let yourself
fall into it.

842
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:19,869
Got it.

843
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,543
I'm fine. I just...

844
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,811
There we go.
Just let it all out.

845
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,013
That's my boy.

846
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,316
Get out of there!

847
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,287
Oh! My noodles!

848
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:38,288
Leave my noodles alone.

849
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,761
Subtle, po. Very subtle.

850
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:45,929
Let me get some of that.

851
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,330
Oh!

852
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,165
Hey, leave my hat alone!

853
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,572
We love noodles!

854
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:56,773
More noodles!

855
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:58,241
Oh! Just like my po.

856
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:03,580
What are you guys
looking at?

857
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,290
That's how we roll!
Cannonball!

858
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,126
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

859
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,606
Here, bring it up here.

860
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:30,373
Mom, look it!
Whoa!

861
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,380
How was that?

862
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,720
Whoa!

863
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:46,723
Now, you try again.
But don't try so hard.

864
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:48,024
Okay. Okay.

865
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,964
Much better.

866
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,007
Thanks, dad.

867
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,175
For what?

868
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,211
You know, just for,
you know,

869
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:09,412
showing me
what it feels like...

870
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,948
To be a panda.

871
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,184
So, when do you think
I'll be ready?

872
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,719
Ready?

873
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:17,887
You know, to learn
how to master chi.

874
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,658
Soon. Real soon.

875
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,792
Come on, I wanna show you
something else.

876
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:23,693
Come on.

877
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,433
Sorry about the mess.
I don't usually
get visitors.

878
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,047
Is this my mom?

879
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,989
I had this done
on your 100th day.

880
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,825
Hmm.

881
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,427
Your momma couldn't
hold you still.

882
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,764
You nearly ate the paper.

883
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:02,765
It's true.

884
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
What was she like?

885
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:05,401
Oh!

886
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,238
She was the total package.

887
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,976
Smart, beautiful...

888
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:15,211
Tremendous appetite.

889
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:20,283
She was the love
of my life.

890
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:23,419
And then, just when I thought
i couldn't get any luckier...

891
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,755
Along you came.

892
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:28,357
My little lotus.

893
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,095
I really had it all...

894
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:37,967
Until that one moment...

895
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:45,408
When I lost everything.

896
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,014
Dad.

897
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:27,316
You don't have to worry
about losing me ever again.

898
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,418
Okay?

899
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,396
Let me get
some of that.

900
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,041
It's from
the eastern province!

901
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:58,281
Master lizard, master ox,
master eagle. All of them.

902
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,417
In every village
from the sea to here...

903
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,886
Every master in China...

904
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,488
Has vanished.

905
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,589
Maybe they are
all at a party.

906
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:08,157
Monkey.

907
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,425
I didn't get
invited either.

908
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:11,861
Kai has taken their chi.

909
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:14,463
We are all that stand
between him...

910
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:17,600
And the knowledge
oogway left in our care.

911
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,869
The villagers, evacuated?

912
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,004
Done, master.

913
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,873
- Crane, mantis?
- Still nothing.

914
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,107
Wait. It's them!

915
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,379
No!

916
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,628
Kai.

917
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,101
Nice.

918
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:53,603
Very tacky.

919
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,974
How dare you set foot
on these grounds!

920
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,877
Look at you pathetic fools.

921
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:04,914
Groveling at the feet
of oogway the magnificent.

922
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,149
You are not fit
to speak his name.

923
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:09,318
I am not fit,
little kitten?

924
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,156
I fought by his side.

925
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,626
I loved him
like a brother.

926
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:20,229
And he betrayed me.

927
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,236
Now I will destroy
everything he has created!

928
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,572
Go!

929
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,528
How's that
for a little kitten?

930
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,581
I will not let you
destroy oogway's memory.

931
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,051
Why not?
He destroyed mine.

932
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:16,218
Mantis.

933
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,187
It is me, your bestie!

934
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,094
Sorry, tigress!

935
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:27,563
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

936
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:28,497
Sorry!

937
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,446
Shifu.

938
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,214
Bring them to me.

939
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:57,026
No.

940
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,160
You must warn po.

941
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:58,995
Master, please.

942
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,240
I will show you the true
power of chi, brother.

943
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:14,510
No.

944
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,649
Oogway, forgive me.

945
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,086
Hmm. What do
you say, oogway?

946
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:58,788
Do you forgive him?

947
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,625
You may have destroyed
the Jade palace...

948
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:05,494
But you will
never succeed.

949
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:09,398
There will always
be someone to stop you.

950
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,833
Who?
The panda?

951
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,302
His chi is strong...

952
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:14,837
But it won't be enough.

953
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:20,176
He will meet
the same fate as you.

954
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:22,178
No.

955
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,513
And so will every panda
in that village.

956
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,121
Yes.

957
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,861
Po, I hope you're ready.

958
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,867
Dance, lotus. Dance.

959
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,471
He's so handsome.

960
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:49,738
Ooh!

961
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,207
Hi!

962
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,209
That's a panda hug!

963
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,444
Hey.

964
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,317
Po.

965
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:38,787
Tigress?

966
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,526
Who's she?

967
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:44,493
Who is that?

968
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:47,763
Big stripy baby!

969
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,933
What are you doing here?

970
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,735
Kai attacked the valley.

971
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,403
He's taken every master
in China,

972
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,671
including shifu
and the others.

973
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,474
It's all gone, po.
Everything. Everyone.

974
00:52:58,476 --> 00:52:59,542
Everyone?

975
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:00,409
Everyone.

976
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,811
How's my restaurant?

977
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,315
We'll talk later.

978
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:07,516
And now he's
on his way here.

979
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,818
He's after you, po.

980
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,188
He's after all pandas.

981
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,355
How long do we have?

982
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,657
Not long.

983
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,792
Please, tell me
you've mastered chi.

984
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,360
Here, take the baby.
Dad! Dad!

985
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,695
Okay, who belongs
to this one?

986
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,564
You need to teach me
the secret
chi technique now!

987
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:23,299
No, no, I'm afraid
you need more time.

988
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:26,435
Everyone, go get your things!
Let me help you with that.

989
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:27,770
I don't have more time.
I need to learn it now!

990
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:29,738
Sorry, you're not ready.

991
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,373
Okay, pack everything!

992
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,441
- I am ready.
- Not quite.

993
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,543
What are you
talking about?

994
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,544
I've done everything
you've asked.

995
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,979
I've mastered napping,
sleeping in,

996
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,781
hammocks, hot tubs.

997
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,616
I am totally at one
with my panda parts.

998
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:41,684
Now why won't
you show me?

999
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:43,519
Because I don't know it!

1000
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,424
You what?

1001
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:50,593
I don't know it, okay?
No one does.

1002
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:51,460
Maybe we used to.

1003
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:53,862
But not anymore.

1004
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:55,564
You lied?

1005
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,832
No, I...

1006
00:53:58,536 --> 00:54:00,302
Yes.

1007
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,438
Wh... why?

1008
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,673
To save your life!

1009
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,943
I find out some
blade-swinging maniac
is coming for you.

1010
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:11,680
What am I supposed to do?
Just let that happen?

1011
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:15,851
Yes! I'm the dragon warrior.
Facing maniacs,
that's my job!

1012
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:19,421
But because of you,
i left the valley
unprotected.

1013
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,023
I left my friends
unprotected!

1014
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,258
And now they're all...

1015
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,326
They're all...

1016
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:25,561
And you would
have been, too.

1017
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,698
I lost you once.

1018
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,600
I am not going
to lose you again.

1019
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,470
I can't.

1020
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,777
You just did.

1021
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,523
Mom! Pick me!

1022
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:58,827
Oh!

1023
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,333
Po, I'm so worried
for you...

1024
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:06,935
That I can't even
enjoy being right
about everything.

1025
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,672
Now run, run, run,
as fast as those
chubby legs can go!

1026
00:55:09,674 --> 00:55:11,407
Run?
There's nowhere to run.

1027
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:12,975
But what are you
going to do?

1028
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:16,045
I'm gonna stay,
and fight that monster.

1029
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:19,381
Po, he may be a monster,
but he's still your father.

1030
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:20,549
Not him. Kai!

1031
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,484
No!

1032
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:08,897
Hungry?

1033
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,866
No, I... not really.

1034
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,102
Well, maybe just one.

1035
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:18,040
You know, you weren't
the only one who was lying.

1036
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,508
Oh?

1037
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,009
I didn't really come along

1038
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,879
because I was worried po
would go hungry.

1039
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,881
I was worried about you.

1040
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,483
Worried that I'd go hungry?

1041
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:28,984
No.

1042
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,420
I was worried
you'd steal po from me.

1043
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:32,688
I'd what?

1044
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,990
I know.
That was crazy.

1045
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,594
But I realize having you

1046
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:41,730
in po's life doesn't mean
less for me.

1047
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,665
It means more for po.

1048
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,467
Oh.

1049
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,571
Well, I'm not in his life.

1050
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,039
Not anymore.

1051
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,642
Your son got mad at you.

1052
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:55,511
Welcome to parenthood.

1053
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:57,946
You don't understand.
I lied to him.

1054
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,482
He'll never forgive me.

1055
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:02,951
I lied to him
for 20 years.

1056
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:04,553
He still thinks
he came from an egg.

1057
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:09,925
Sometimes, we do
the wrong things
for the right reasons.

1058
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,201
Look.

1059
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:20,702
He's hurt.

1060
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,471
He's confused.

1061
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,642
And he still has
to save the world.

1062
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:29,144
He needs both his dads.

1063
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,531
This isn't going to work.

1064
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:50,833
It has to.

1065
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:51,900
You're not
thinking straight.

1066
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:53,469
I am!
You're not.

1067
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:54,503
I am!
No.

1068
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,771
Yes, I am.
No.

1069
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:57,673
I've seen Kai.

1070
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:59,675
I've seen what he can do.

1071
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:01,143
But he hasn't seen
what I can do.

1072
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,582
The wuxi finger hold?

1073
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:08,784
It's my best move.

1074
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,152
I just have to get to Kai,

1075
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,820
grab his finger
and then skadoosh!

1076
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,522
Back to the spirit realm.

1077
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:15,123
He has an army
of Jade warriors.

1078
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,059
Everything they see,
he sees.

1079
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:18,794
So there's no
sneaking up on him.

1080
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:19,895
You will never get

1081
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:21,163
close enough.
It's gonna work!

1082
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:27,035
He can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

1083
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:29,004
Oh, you sound just like shifu
with the, "chi, chi, chi."

1084
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,973
"Chi this. Chi that."
"Chi, chi, chi!"

1085
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:33,275
I'm not a master
of chi, okay?

1086
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:34,810
I don't know if I'm
the dragon warrior.

1087
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,211
I don't even know
if I'm a panda!

1088
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:37,513
I don't know who I am!

1089
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,884
You're right.

1090
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:43,519
There's no way
i can stop him
and his army.

1091
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,259
Unless you had
an army of your own.

1092
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,663
You?

1093
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:56,899
Not just me.

1094
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:58,700
Us.

1095
00:58:58,702 --> 00:58:59,768
All of us.

1096
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:14,216
I finally found my son,
after all these years.

1097
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,652
It's going to take a lot more
than the end of the world...

1098
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:17,953
To keep us apart.

1099
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:19,888
But you don't even
know kung fu.

1100
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,624
Then you will teach us.

1101
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:25,594
What? I can't
teach you kung fu.

1102
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:31,066
I couldn't even teach tigress.
And she already knows kung fu!

1103
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:35,337
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.

1104
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,973
But you gotta believe me.

1105
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,875
We can do this.

1106
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:42,044
We can learn kung fu.

1107
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,313
We can be just like you!

1108
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,950
What did you just say?
Uh...

1109
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:49,084
"We can do this"?
No!

1110
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,887
"We can learn kung fu"?
After that!

1111
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:53,121
Uh...
"We can be
just like you"?

1112
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,723
Yes!
We can?

1113
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,325
No! You can't!

1114
00:59:57,861 --> 00:59:58,827
But you don't have to be!

1115
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,030
That's what shifu meant.

1116
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,799
I don't have to
turn you into me.

1117
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:04,733
I have to turn
you into you!

1118
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,869
That doesn't
make any sense.

1119
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:09,838
I know!

1120
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,373
Thanks, dads.

1121
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,241
You're welcome?

1122
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:15,944
I'm gonna do something
i never thought
I'd be able to do.

1123
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,846
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

1124
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,884
You guys,
your real strength
comes from being

1125
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:23,952
the best "you" you can be.

1126
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,654
So who are you?

1127
01:00:25,656 --> 01:00:26,922
<i> What are you good at?</i>

1128
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:28,690
<i> What do you love?</i>

1129
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:30,792
<i> What makes you, "you"?</i>
Whoo-hoo!

1130
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:34,930
Yes, good. Good. Again.

1131
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,267
Good. Again.

1132
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,770
Good, good, good. Again.

1133
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,641
Stripy baby! Stripy baby!

1134
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:49,878
Faster, faster!
Twirl those ribbons!

1135
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,213
Hug that log, you!

1136
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:53,148
Hug that log
like it's the last time

1137
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,150
you're ever gonna hug it
goodbye forever.

1138
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,685
Higher! And a little more
to the left this time.

1139
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:57,719
You can do it!

1140
01:00:57,721 --> 01:00:59,388
Whoo-hoo!

1141
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,156
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1142
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,991
I don't wanna see
any of these
hit the ground!

1143
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,938
Wait, wait, stripy baby!

1144
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,907
Good! Try it with this.

1145
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:23,178
Now try it with these!

1146
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,317
Good!
Now try it with these.

1147
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,790
Oh! Oh!

1148
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:02,951
Whoo!

1149
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,387
They are ready.

1150
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,492
What?

1151
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:12,494
Okay, pay attention because
I'm only gonna go over this

1152
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:14,162
ten more times.

1153
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:17,165
The only entrance
to the village is here.

1154
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,501
The dumpling squadron
will take position here...

1155
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:22,237
While the cookie squadron
will take position here.

1156
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,272
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

1157
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,910
Right, okay.

1158
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,011
The noodle squadron will...

1159
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,953
Okay. Anyway,
the important thing
to remember

1160
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:39,054
is that this is the spot
where...

1161
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,192
Okay, I saw that coming.

1162
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:45,827
If you only remember
one thing,

1163
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:47,395
it's distract the jombies...

1164
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:50,132
Until I get close enough to
put a wuxi finger hold on Kai.

1165
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,767
- You got it?
- Yeah!

1166
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,403
Pandas on three!
One, two three,
pan...!

1167
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:58,340
You guys... never mind,
I'll teach you that later.

1168
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,379
I wish I could have
taught you this, son.

1169
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:38,580
It's okay, dad. I'm...

1170
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,189
He's here.

1171
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,148
Wow!

1172
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,984
That's what I call
a dramatic entrance!

1173
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,258
Ha-ha! You must be
the dragon warrior.

1174
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,294
And you must be Kai!

1175
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,396
Beast of vengeance,
maker of widows!

1176
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:33,401
Yes! Finally!
Thank you!

1177
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,203
Almost makes me wanna
spare your life.

1178
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,072
Oh, you wanna spare me?

1179
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:39,107
How about you spare me
the chit-chat?

1180
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:41,176
All right?
Let's do this.

1181
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:43,345
I'm going to take
your chi...

1182
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:45,947
Then the chi
of every panda in the...

1183
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:47,382
Oh! Chit-chat!

1184
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,050
In this...
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1185
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:49,985
In...
Chat, chat, chat.

1186
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,354
In the...
Chit-chat!

1187
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:54,656
Oh, you pudgy little...

1188
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,996
Round them all up.

1189
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,412
Oh, no. It's true.

1190
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,547
You guys have all been
turned green!

1191
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:21,950
Except for you, mantis.
You were already green.

1192
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,220
Now?
Wait for the signal.

1193
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,024
Here we go!

1194
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,336
Dumpling squad!

1195
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:43,238
Ready?
Go time!

1196
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,673
Belly!
Gong!

1197
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,008
Whoo!

1198
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,078
Seriously?

1199
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:50,078
Yeah! Whoo!
We did it! Whoo-hoo!

1200
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,248
Sorry, crane.

1201
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,591
Spring roll squad!
Time for some takeout!

1202
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,133
Yoo-hoo!

1203
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,035
Over here, Mr. jombie!

1204
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:21,576
I don't know
who you are, either.

1205
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,044
Noodle squad!

1206
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,450
Get ready to dance...

1207
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:30,118
With danger!

1208
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,123
Oh, sweet!

1209
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,403
Stripy baby!

1210
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:49,404
Oh, no.

1211
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:50,772
Whee!

1212
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,343
Do it.
You're mean!

1213
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,584
Fire!

1214
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,592
Fire in the hole!
Oh!

1215
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,260
Yes!

1216
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:14,129
All right, kids!

1217
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:15,163
You got it, guys!

1218
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,235
Oh, no! Master shifu!

1219
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,138
I can't hit shifu!

1220
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,307
I can!

1221
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,176
And so can I.

1222
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,213
Double-dad defense!

1223
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,248
Left, dad!
Right, dad!

1224
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,449
Thanks, dad!

1225
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:35,383
Back at you, dad.

1226
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,185
We've got this, son!

1227
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,354
Go, dads!

1228
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:40,255
Yeah!

1229
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,460
Yeah!

1230
01:07:45,462 --> 01:07:46,728
We got them now.

1231
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,297
Stop.
Stop! Enough!

1232
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,667
Get out...

1233
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,173
Let's finish this.

1234
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:00,842
That's our boy!

1235
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:20,228
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you
back to the spirit realm.

1236
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,196
Skadoosh!

1237
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,801
Okay, that didn't work.
Let me try one more time.

1238
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:30,405
Skadoosh! Skadoosh. Skadoosh.
Skadoo... what the...?

1239
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:32,307
Hold on, wait!
It's working.

1240
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:34,375
No. No!

1241
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:41,649
No, it's not.

1242
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:42,784
Did oogway teach you
that little trick?

1243
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:45,286
Too bad.

1244
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,489
It only works
on mortals.

1245
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:51,159
And I am
a spirit warrior.

1246
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:51,893
Come!

1247
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:21,923
Whoa!

1248
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:38,806
Son!

1249
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,575
Po!

1250
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:44,379
I was wrong.

1251
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,481
I'm sorry. Run. Run!

1252
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,329
So, oogway...

1253
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:04,966
This was the one
destined to stop me?

1254
01:10:04,968 --> 01:10:06,868
I will have his chi...

1255
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,904
And then all of theirs!

1256
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,455
And you...

1257
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,625
You really thought you could

1258
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:32,527
send me back
to the spirit realm?

1259
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,802
You are just
a stupid mortal.

1260
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,005
It only works on mortals.

1261
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:48,543
You're right.
I can't send you there.

1262
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:50,478
But I can take you there.

1263
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:52,914
What's that?

1264
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:55,550
What?

1265
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,418
Po!
Son!

1266
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,721
Skadoosh.

1267
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:00,888
Son!

1268
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:02,557
No!

1269
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,514
What happened?

1270
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:27,348
Where's po?

1271
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:31,386
He took Kai away.
He saved us.

1272
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:32,387
No.

1273
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,025
He saved us,
but who's saving him?

1274
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,564
Whoa!

1275
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:45,800
The spirit realm.
It worked!

1276
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,602
Get off me, you...

1277
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,773
You brought me back?

1278
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,074
Don't blame me.
I tried to finish this

1279
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,409
in the regular realm.

1280
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:56,077
Then we'll finish it here!

1281
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,053
Whoa!

1282
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,914
Come on, son. Fight!

1283
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,522
We have to help him.

1284
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,825
We have to help him!

1285
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:45,093
Okay.
Everyone gather around.

1286
01:12:45,095 --> 01:12:47,362
That's it.
Come in close.
Come on.

1287
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:48,830
We can do this.

1288
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,539
<i> Po...</i>

1289
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,142
You taught us
who we were
meant to be.

1290
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,981
A father.

1291
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,053
A friend.

1292
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,489
A dumpling kicker.

1293
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:15,590
A lethal fighting machine.

1294
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,024
A hugger.

1295
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,895
A nunchuck chick.

1296
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,097
Stripy baby.

1297
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:25,800
A family.

1298
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:56,831
Sweet!

1299
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,008
Whoa.

1300
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:14,549
Who are you?

1301
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:16,184
I've been asking
the same question.

1302
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:22,557
Am I the son of a panda?

1303
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,759
The son of a goose?

1304
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:25,660
A student?

1305
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:27,929
A teacher?

1306
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:30,565
Turns out...

1307
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:32,467
I'm all of them.

1308
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,846
I am the dragon warrior.

1309
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,949
Get it?
See the giant dragon?

1310
01:14:49,886 --> 01:14:51,586
Get ready to
feel the thunder.

1311
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,921
This is awesome!

1312
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,929
Whoo-hoo!

1313
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,633
Hmm.

1314
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,107
Uh-oh.

1315
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,215
Belly gong.

1316
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:23,885
Butt slap.

1317
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,556
Perhaps a bit of lunch.

1318
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:29,590
Because I'm starving.

1319
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,161
Mmm.

1320
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,311
Let's do this!

1321
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,183
Heads up!

1322
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:15,670
It took me 500 years
to take oogway's chi.

1323
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:18,806
I will have yours
if it takes me 500 more.

1324
01:16:18,808 --> 01:16:19,874
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1325
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:21,776
Chit-chat.

1326
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,188
You want my chi so bad...

1327
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:35,723
Then take it.

1328
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,632
Yes.

1329
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:46,968
The power is mine.

1330
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:52,340
Wait. No. It's too much.

1331
01:16:52,342 --> 01:16:54,241
That's too much! No!

1332
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,047
No!

1333
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:11,993
Oh!

1334
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:13,361
Where did he go?

1335
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,067
Oh!

1336
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:22,770
We're back!

1337
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:24,038
Bestie!

1338
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,973
I'm still green!
It didn't work!

1339
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,775
Oh, wait.
That's my normal green.

1340
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:29,310
Greeny baby!

1341
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,412
Not a baby.
Not a baby!

1342
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:32,413
Antenna of fear!

1343
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,715
What about po?

1344
01:17:34,717 --> 01:17:35,783
Have you seen po?

1345
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,184
No. He's not here?

1346
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,721
Po? Po?

1347
01:17:40,723 --> 01:17:42,289
Why isn't he back?

1348
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,902
Dragon warrior.

1349
01:17:54,904 --> 01:17:57,204
Oogway? Whoa!

1350
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,809
I can't believe it.

1351
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:03,277
Whoa!

1352
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:04,879
You are extra shiny.

1353
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:06,247
As are you.

1354
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:08,215
I know, right?
It's like the best
cape ever.

1355
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,685
When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.

1356
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,020
It suits you.
You've grown.

1357
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,889
Yep. I gotta lay off
the panda buffet.

1358
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,691
Grown up...

1359
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,293
As I hoped you would

1360
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:22,163
when I sent the message
to your father.

1361
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:24,865
You sent
the universe mail.
Whoa!

1362
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,001
Yes.

1363
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:29,737
Because the universe
needed you.

1364
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:32,406
Me?

1365
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:36,811
You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.

1366
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:38,979
But, how'd you know
i could?

1367
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:41,449
On the first day
we met...

1368
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:44,285
I saw the future
of kung fu.

1369
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,789
<i> And the past.</i>

1370
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:55,096
<i> I saw the panda</i>
<i> who could unite them both.</i>

1371
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:58,099
<i> That is why I chose you, po.</i>

1372
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,769
Both sides of
a yin and Yang.

1373
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:06,774
And my true successor.

1374
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:11,779
Me? I can't take that.

1375
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:13,514
Just take it.

1376
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:14,515
I have a bigger one.

1377
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:20,020
I mean, you're enlightened
and everything. I'm just...

1378
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:22,356
Oh!

1379
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:23,457
Really?

1380
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:24,859
Yes.

1381
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,904
Now what do we do?

1382
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:38,806
Hmm. You tell me.

1383
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:42,209
No. Oogway, don't go!

1384
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:45,513
I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.

1385
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:46,847
Oh, right.

1386
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:51,886
It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

1387
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,522
Wait. I can go back?

1388
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:57,158
Who knows?
I've never tried.

1389
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:12,540
Wow!

1390
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,053
Po!
Oh!

1391
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:28,088
You can fly! Oh!

1392
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,995
Dad. Dad.

1393
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:36,564
Dads!

1394
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:37,464
Son!

1395
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:43,871
Don't you go disappearing
in petals ever again.

1396
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:45,539
We thought we lost you.

1397
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,241
No, you saved me.

1398
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,210
You all did.

1399
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:53,581
Now, come on over here!

1400
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,216
Hugs!

1401
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,021
Master shifu!

1402
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:04,024
The student has truly
become the tea...

1403
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,459
Wait.
Where did you
get that?

1404
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:08,028
Oh, this.
Oogway gave it to me
in the spirit realm.

1405
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,931
Oh... of course he did.

1406
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:12,499
I think I mastered chi.

1407
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:16,370
Of course you did.

1408
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,607
Can you teach me?

1409
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,178
Ready!

1410
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,000
Whoa!

1411
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:49,003
Ow!

1412
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,174
Monkey, help me!

1413
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,143
Greeny baby!

1414
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:57,678
Get 'em off me!

1415
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,386
Mmm! Hello.

1416
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:16,964
Skadoosh.

1417
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,473
Panda asthma.
