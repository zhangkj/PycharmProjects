Oh-ooh!
Stairs.
I don't think I can...
You guys,
I'll catch up!
Sweet.
Ah.
Inner peace.
Inner peace.
Itchy nose.
Finally, inner peace.
Now what?
Kai, old friend.
Master oogway.
Our battle ended
Well, now I'm ready
Took you long enough!
You've grown stronger.
I have taken the chi
No!
Yes.
And soon I will have
When will you realize?
The more you take,
With your chi,
I will finally be able
And this time,
It was never my destiny
I have set another
Then I will find him...
And take his chi, too.
Justice is about
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haw!
We'll have two
Um... three.
And a few tofu buns.
Oh, the spicy noodle soup
Did you want
She wants it
On the side.
- Go, dragon warrior!
Go, dragon warrior!
Defend the valley!
Dragon warrior!
Go, dragon warrior!
Defend the valley!
Yee-haw!
You guys aren't doing
Do we have to strike a pose
You guys,
the power
I've heard about
just by throwing
Oh!
Dramatic entrance?
Master shifu.
The dragon warrior
Really?
Uh, yeah.
Before the battle of the fist
Hence,
Oh!
Nice dramatic entrance.
Today will be
Your final...?
I didn't even know
Although you have
I'm not sick.
...healthy.
My final class,
Your training will be
of the dragon warrior.
What?
Me, teach? Why not tigress?
She's always telling everyone
Be quiet, po.
You see what I mean?
Tigress is not
You are.
Come on,
What could I teach them?
There is always something
For instance...
Let me show you
The dramatic exit.
What's that?
Wow! Are you kidding me?
Where'd he go?
Master.
He's gone, guys.
We await your
All you have to lose
I mean, seriously,
Very bad!
Okay, okay.
Monkey!
Yes, master!
Tigress, tornado back flip!
Yes, master.
Oh, no! Fire!
- Fire!
Sorry! My fault.
Crane, go high.
Ah, my claw thingy!
Uh, viper and tigress, do,
uh, like,
Uh, you two,
With a yellow tail,
I'm sorry.
Good job, po.
Ah!
Did you at least learn
Yes.
That you can't teach.
And tigress is flammable,
Yeah, that was
Uh, I'm glad
What a loser!
What was shifu thinking?
What was oogway thinking?
I think he heard us.
I didn't hear anything.
Uh, he said
I'm sorry, oogway.
Would you stop doing that?
How was your
Humiliating.
I heard.
Who told you?
I heard from monkey,
And your dad, and Mrs. chao
And those ducks
And tigress told me.
Did she also tell you that
Because I'm done.
Teaching or
Both! I don't know
I could teach that class.
Oh, I knew you couldn't.
What?
If you only do
you will never be
I don't wanna be more!
You don't even know
What do you...?
I'm the dragon warrior.
And what exactly does
Hmm.
It means, you know,
and punching and kicking.
Defending the valley!
Punching and kicking?
You think that is what
the great master oogway
A 500-year prophecy
so you could
And running through town
Yes?
Oogway saw greatness
Against my better judgment.
More than you can see
Incredible power
Power beyond anything
Wow! What was that?
That was chi.
Wow!
What's chi?
The energy that flows
So you're saying
I'll be able to do
No. I'm saying
I'll be able to do
Oh.
Mastering chi requires
Oogway sat alone
for 30 years
"Who am I?"
"Who am I?"
I'm lucky
before you interrupt...
So now I have to sit alone
Eventually.
After you master teaching.
Teaching? There's no way
I'm not trying
I'm trying to turn you
Turn me into me?
Wait a second,
Almost there, shifu.
Just a little more confusing
Hmm...Oh! Uh...
Sorry, no offense,
I'll let you get back
What is this place?
Uh... my brother's farm?
Ah.
If I stepped on you,
Yes.
The mortal realm.
You hear that, oogway?
Kai has returned!
Who?
Kai. General Kai.
Supreme warlord
Huh?
The Jade slayer.
You may know me as
Uh... maker of widows?
Uh...
Okay, I used to
Oh, master oogway!
Now, he was a great warrior.
We've heard
Okay, okay, enough.
Find oogway's students,
By the time I am done
There will be no one left
Kai is coming!
I am ready...
To teach you a lesson.
Teach me? Oh, no!
Yeah, he's so handsome!
Thank you
No! Please don't
Po?
Oh, hey, dad.
I was just, uh...
Okay. What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing? I come home
to find you taking
Action figures.
...and instead of adding
you just added
Szechuan...
Oh, oh, my tenders! Oh...
Okay, yes,
There, there, son.
You tell your daddy
Lift your arm.
Shifu says I don't know
to be the dragon warrior.
Now I have to
I thought I finally
If I'm not
A teacher?
Po, that's a promotion!
Take the job, son!
And, someday when
of the whole Jade palace...
I can sell noodles
Why are you still here
Get out! Get up!
Go, go, go!
But what about
Oh, Mrs. chow

Someone's about to beat your

And who's
Yeah!
Is that a new record?
Who are you?
I am li shan.
What?

I'm looking for my son.
You lost your son?
Yes.
Many years ago.
I lost my father.
I'm very sorry.
Thank you.
Well, good luck to you.
You, too.
I hope you find your son.
And I hope you find

Look at that.
Our bellies
That is so cool.
Hey, son, let me teach you

Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
It's like looking

Huh?
But I still
I thought po
No.
Where?
A secret panda village
A secret panda...
Whoa.
But how did you know
I received a message
How could you receive
if no one could find you?
Sounds suspicious to me.
Hmm?
No, it was a message
Whoa!
Rats!
Now, what's all
How did you know
Did the universe
No, the poster did.
And the gift shop.
I bought a tiny cup.
Oh, right, of course!
You have no idea.
You're gonna be
Come on, come on!
I'm already

Feeling the burn.
Do you have

Get out of my head, dad!
If I could fit in it?
If you could?
Oh.

The battle helmets
They're so tiny!
Master dolphin's
This is my favorite.
Check it out.
battle rickshaw
Sweet ride.
Dad, what are you doing?
We're not supposed
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Yeah, you probably should.
You look so cool, though.
How does it feel?
Do the hinges hinge?
Does it feel like
Does it feel like
And emerge unscathed?
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Ooh!
I wonder what this does.
I think I just
Anything else
Hmm?
Charge!
Faster, faster, faster!
Thumb war!
Reinforcements!
No fair. No fair.

There you go.
Dolphin-style attack!
You got me.
Go long, son!
Whoa!

Coming back at you.
I'm going high!
Come on, throw it!
I'm coming for you.
Bring it on, master rhino.
Here I come!
Oh!
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you,
Psst. Psst. Psst
Who's got you?
Who's gonna get you?
Master rhino.
What? What's wrong?
Hello.
Guys, guys.
You're never gonna guess
Not in a million years.
You just try.
Your father!
Whoa!
Oh, wait a second.
We look exactly the same.
Dad, say hi to my friends.
Mantis, tigress,
Oh, viper, was it?
They're kind of
This is master shifu.
Uh... it is an honor
Perhaps your father
in the training hall.
Your son will be
Oh, ho, ho!
I'm sure you're tired.
I'm gonna show him
What, tired?
I would love
Trust me, it'll be more fun
Fight!
What is that?
The valley's under attack.
Son? Under attack?
This is perfect!
Now you can see what being
the dragon warrior's
Follow me!
Enemies of justice,
Are you kidding me? Whoa!
Ow!
What's the deal
Some kind of Jade zombies.
Jade zombies?
Jombies! Jinx!
Ow!
Lotus, be careful!
It's okay, dad,
Whoa!
The master badger twins,
with their crushing
Ow!
Yeah, that's the one!
And that guy is...
No! Master porcupine!
I thought he died
These guys are legend!
Get a quick sketch of us.
Did you get it?
Oh, I blinked.
Can we get another one?
I'm being choked
This is so cool.
Oh! Oh, look. It's you!
Po, focus!
"Message from the universe."
I'll give you a message
Stay away from my son!
Sorry, dad.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Uh, take this one.
Lotus! Watch out!
Whoa!
Dad, check out
Gotcha.
I see you.
<i> Your chi will soon be mine.</i>
Is he talking to me?
They're all talking.
Whoa, you're right.
We should try that, too.
Okay, but we gotta plan
Otherwise, it won't be scary.
<i> It's not them talking,</i>
<i> It's me talking</i>
Who?
Okay, okay, okay.
Did you see that?
The green smoke,
Shifu, what was that?
Kai... Kai... Kai...
Nope, never heard of him.
Kai... Kai...
Where is it?
There's so much
Yes!
Behold.
All the answers
What? It's blank?
Are you kidding me?
Wait, wait, hold on.
Oh, okay. Here we go.
It is written
"Long ago,
Oogway had a brother?
"In arms. In arms."
Maybe you should just
"I was an ambitious
<i> And fighting</i>
<i> My closest friend.</i>
<i> One day,</i>
<i> I was badly wounded.</i>
<i> My friend carried me</i>
<i> Until we came</i>
<i> High in the mountains.</i>
<i> An ancient</i>
<i> A village of pandas.</i>
Pandas?
<i> Yes, pandas.</i>
<i> Pandas who used</i>
<i> They taught me</i>

"True master of chi"?
Like you!
Me? I can barely
I need at least
We need a chi master.
He will
the chi of masters
We have to think
He'll get more
with every master
- There is no choice.
I can teach you, son.
You can do this?
Of course.
That must be why
Okay, so what do i
You have to come home
What?
To the secret village?
Yes, son.
You must rediscover
You have to learn
sleep like a panda...
Eat like a panda.
Those 103 dumplings?
I was just warming up.
I've always felt like
to my full potential.
No, you can't take po
I want a second opinion.
Shifu, open another scroll
I think he should go.
Fine, a third opinion.
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?
Dad, you heard
This guy can only be stopped
And I can only master chi
Well, I'm a panda.
I'll pack you a lunch
Do you really think
Doesn't matter
It only matters
So, that's a "no"?
Master, what are
You are going to find out
Follow the trail
But do not engage...
For with every foe he faces,
Why me?
No. It is because
Should have kept
And take mantis.
Oh, man.
Yes.
Oh! Lunch break.
Oh.
You don't need
Dad?
Yes?
Yes?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing?
Did you have to step
No, I mean,
What was I supposed
What if the pandas
You're never gonna be able
on an empty stomach.
I consider my presence
Oh... yes, about that...
We can't share
Well, you think I can't
I raised po for 20 years
before I finally told him
Seriously?
Okay. I guess it would be
You can fly?
I'm a bird, po.
We're here.
Sure looks like a long
And my son hates stairs.
So, let's go home.
We're pandas.
I've waited my whole life
Rats.
Whoa... huh?
This is the secret
No wonder
If I lived here,
Now you can "whoa."
Whoa!

Look over there!

So...That's nice.
I don't know who you are.
Oh, stripy baby.
Oh! Okay, careful with that.
Can I keep her? Can I?

Yeah.
Take good care of her.
Yes! Stripy baby.
You look just like me,
You're like me, but old.
You're like me,
You're like me, but...

Mmm!
Yeah, that's the good stuff.
Have some dumplings.
What kind of panda
Well, I'm kind of new at this
Hey, what kind of panda
You have a funny neck.
I'm not a panda at all.
What's that? What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
No more questions!
Here, son.

Just because you say
It doesn't mean that you're
It's like me saying

Wings of disagreement.
Whoa! There.
Master bear,
What are you doing out here?
Jade creatures
We've tracked them here.
Stop!
They must be in there.
Master shifu strongly
Not to engage.
We've gotta get in there.
You're seriously afraid?
Even master chicken's going
That's it. I'm going in.
Mantis! We have orders
They need our help!

Mom, look it!
How was that?
Whoa!
Now, you try again.
Okay. Okay.
Much better.
Thanks, dad.
For what?
You know, just for,
showing me
To be a panda.
So, when do you think
Ready?
You know, to learn
Soon. Real soon.
Come on, I wanna show you
Come on.
Sorry about the mess.
Is this my mom?
I had this done
Hmm.
Your momma couldn't
You nearly ate the paper.
It's true.
What was she like?
Oh!
She was the total package.
Smart, beautiful...
Tremendous appetite.
She was the love
And then, just when I thought
Along you came.
My little lotus.
I really had it all...
Until that one moment...
When I lost everything.
Dad.
You don't have to worry
Okay?
Let me get
It's from
Master lizard, master ox,
In every village
Every master in China...
Has vanished.
Maybe they are
Monkey.
I didn't get
Kai has taken their chi.
We are all that stand
And the knowledge
The villagers, evacuated?
Done, master.
- Crane, mantis?
Wait. It's them!
No!
Kai.
Nice.
Very tacky.
How dare you set foot
Look at you pathetic fools.
Groveling at the feet
You are not fit
I am not fit,
I fought by his side.
I loved him
And he betrayed me.
Now I will destroy
Go!
How's that
I will not let you
Why not?
Mantis.
It is me, your bestie!
Sorry, tigress!
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
Sorry!
Shifu.
Bring them to me.
No.
You must warn po.
Master, please.
I will show you the true
No.
Oogway, forgive me.
Hmm. What do
Do you forgive him?
You may have destroyed
But you will
There will always
Who?
His chi is strong...
But it won't be enough.
He will meet
No.
And so will every panda
Yes.
Po, I hope you're ready.
Dance, lotus. Dance.
He's so handsome.
Ooh!
Hi!
That's a panda hug!
Hey.
Po.
Tigress?
Who's she?
Who is that?
Big stripy baby!
What are you doing here?
Kai attacked the valley.
He's taken every master
including shifu
It's all gone, po.
Everyone?
Everyone.
How's my restaurant?
We'll talk later.
And now he's
He's after you, po.
He's after all pandas.
How long do we have?
Not long.
Please, tell me
Here, take the baby.
Okay, who belongs
You need to teach me
No, no, I'm afraid
Everyone, go get your things!
I don't have more time.
Sorry, you're not ready.
Okay, pack everything!
- I am ready.
What are you
I've done everything
I've mastered napping,
hammocks, hot tubs.
I am totally at one
Now why won't
Because I don't know it!
You what?
I don't know it, okay?
Maybe we used to.
But not anymore.
You lied?
No, I...
Yes.
Wh... why?
To save your life!
I find out some
What am I supposed to do?
Yes! I'm the dragon warrior.
But because of you,
I left my friends
And now they're all...
They're all...
And you would
I lost you once.
I am not going
I can't.
You just did.
Mom! Pick me!
Oh!
Po, I'm so worried
That I can't even
Now run, run, run,
Run?
But what are you
I'm gonna stay,
Po, he may be a monster,
Not him. Kai!
No!
Hungry?
No, I... not really.
Well, maybe just one.
You know, you weren't
Oh?
I didn't really come along
because I was worried po
I was worried about you.
Worried that I'd go hungry?
No.
I was worried
I'd what?
I know.
But I realize having you
in po's life doesn't mean
It means more for po.
Oh.
Well, I'm not in his life.
Not anymore.
Your son got mad at you.
Welcome to parenthood.
You don't understand.
He'll never forgive me.
I lied to him
He still thinks
Sometimes, we do
Look.
He's hurt.
He's confused.
And he still has
He needs both his dads.
This isn't going to work.
It has to.
You're not
I am!
I am!
Yes, I am.
I've seen Kai.
I've seen what he can do.
But he hasn't seen
The wuxi finger hold?
It's my best move.
I just have to get to Kai,
grab his finger
Back to the spirit realm.
He has an army
Everything they see,
So there's no
You will never get
close enough.
He can only be stopped
Oh, you sound just like shifu
"Chi this. Chi that."
I'm not a master
I don't know if I'm
I don't even know
I don't know who I am!
You're right.
There's no way
Unless you had
You?
Not just me.
Us.
All of us.
I finally found my son,
It's going to take a lot more
To keep us apart.
But you don't even
Then you will teach us.
What? I can't
I couldn't even teach tigress.
Po, I know I'm the last guy
But you gotta believe me.
We can do this.
We can learn kung fu.
We can be just like you!
What did you just say?
"We can do this"?
"We can learn kung fu"?
Uh...
Yes!
No! You can't!
But you don't have to be!
That's what shifu meant.
I don't have to
I have to turn
That doesn't
I know!
Thanks, dads.
You're welcome?
I'm gonna do something
I'm gonna teach kung fu.
You guys,
the best "you" you can be.
So who are you?
<i> What are you good at?</i>
<i> What do you love?</i>
<i> What makes you, "you"?</i>
Yes, good. Good. Again.
Good. Again.
Good, good, good. Again.
Stripy baby! Stripy baby!
Faster, faster!
Hug that log, you!
Hug that log

Higher! And a little more
You can do it!

Right, okay.
The noodle squadron will...

Until I get close enough to

Pandas on three!
You guys... never mind,
I wish I could have
It's okay, dad. I'm...
He's here.
Wow!
That's what I call
Ha-ha! You must be
And you must be Kai!
Beast of vengeance,
Yes! Finally!
Almost makes me wanna
Oh, you wanna spare me?
How about you spare me
All right?
I'm going to take
Then the chi
Oh! Chit-chat!
In this...

Oh, you pudgy little...
Round them all up.
Oh, no. It's true.
